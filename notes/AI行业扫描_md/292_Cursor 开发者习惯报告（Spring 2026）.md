Developer acceleration

Developers are working faster and producing more code, but the changes in developer productivity go far beyond volume.

AI is also changing the shape of the work, with PRs getting larger, agent sessions going deeper, and AI-generated code surviving in codebases for longer periods of time.

The economics of intelligence

As models get more capable, use more context, and take on deeper tasks, cost becomes a bigger part of the product experience.

To understand cost-intelligence tradeoffs, we looked at model economics from three perspectives: request cost, accepted-code efficiency, and the relationship between cost and benchmark performance.

The power user gap

AI is changing productivity across the board, but is concentrated at the top end of the user distribution.

P99 power users are achieving significantly larger gains than everyone else, and the gap is growing much larger on an absolute basis as total AI usage grows.

The rise of context

As models take on more complex work, they are using more context to understand the codebase, the user’s intent, and the surrounding workflow before producing output. This shift has favorable cost implications because input tokens cost much less than output tokens, and cache-read tokens cost even less.

The shift toward context can help models produce better-calibrated code, consistent with the rising diff survival share we saw in developer productivity.

The shift to automation

AI coding tools started as a way to accelerate individual developers. We saw this impact in earlier sections of the report, with faster coding, larger PRs, deeper agent sessions, and more AI-generated code making it into commits.

Now AI software development is entering a new era, with AI becoming infrastructure for automating more of the software development lifecycle end to end.

Methodology
A field transformed#

The change sweeping through software development is astounding. This inaugural Developer Habits Report, based on Cursor data, captures that transformation across five themes:

Developer acceleration. We chart how coding speed has doubled year-over-year, PRs are getting larger and deeper, and agent-generated code is surviving review at higher rates than ever.

The economics of intelligence. We benchmark seven model families on cost per line and cost per submit, revealing wide heterogeneity in unit economics.

The power user gap. We find that while AI is leading to broad productivity gains, the change is most pronounced in the top 1% of developers.  

The rise of context. We show the dramatic increase in input tokens, and the shift toward cache-read tokens, which is giving agents the working memory to take on more complex tasks and produce higher-quality code.

The shift to automation. Finally, we look at how coding agents are evolving from a tool used by individual developers into an entire system for building and maintaining software, often automatically.

This report provides a data-driven fixed point for understanding where agentic software development stands today, and where it appears to be headed next.

Developer acceleration#
Code is moving faster#

Developers are adding more code per week, with growth accelerating since the start of 2026. While this is not a perfect metric, it provides a directionally interesting baseline for understanding how developer work is changing.

Developers are taking on larger units of work#

Mega PRs, defined as PRs with at least 1,000 lines changed, are becoming more common as developers use AI to take on larger units of work in a single PR. It's interesting to see the jump in mega PRs in January 2026, when many developers were trying out the latest improvements in coding agents and models.

Agent sessions are getting deeper#

In just the last two months, average tool calls per session have risen roughly 30%. Coding agents are taking on more complex work, reading and editing files, searching code, running shell commands, and browsing the web more frequently.

The economics of intelligence#
Request costs differ widely by model family#

Cost per agent request varies by nearly 9x across model families, showing that the same workflow can have very different cost profiles depending on the model behind it.

Cost per accepted line narrows the model gap#

Cost per accepted line varies by roughly 7x across model families, compared with nearly 9x for cost per request, suggesting that higher-cost models partially make up the difference by producing more accepted code per request.

The power user gap#
Power users account for a large share of AI activity#

AI usage is highly concentrated, with a small share of developers accounting for a large share of AI lines, spend, and token consumption.

The Lorenz curves show this concentration, with Gini scores of 0.77, 0.75, and 0.72 across the three metrics, where higher scores on a 0-to-1 scale mean activity is more concentrated among fewer users.

Inequality steepens at the tail#

Here’s another view of how dramatically the power-user gap widens at the tail.

P99 developers produce 46x more lines than the median active user and merge 15x more PRs than the median active PR author, while p90 users show large but much smaller gaps.

The rise of context#
Models are reading more before they write#

The ratio of input to output tokens is rising quickly, showing that models are consuming much more context for every token they produce. This shift suggests that models are doing more work up front before generating code.

Input tokens now dominate non-cache token volume#

The same relative shift toward input tokens shows up in the token mix. Input now accounts for more than 90% of input-output token volume, making context the dominant part of non-cache model usage.

Input context is becoming the main token cost#

Input tokens dominate token consumption, but their effect on cost is moderated by their lower unit price.

Even so, input tokens have become the majority of price-equivalent token costs, rising since the start of the year from roughly half of input/output token costs to nearly 70%.

Cache-reads dominate token activity#

The context story becomes even larger once cache is included. Cache-read tokens dominate total token activity, showing how much agent work now depends on reusing prior context rather than reading everything from scratch. We continually improve our agent harness to best cache tokens across models and providers.

The shift to automation#
More AI changes are being accepted automatically#

Since the start of the year, more than 5x as many agent-generated changes are reaching commits without a separate manual diff acceptance step, suggesting that developers are trusting agents to carry more work through the commit flow.

Automation is spreading across workflows#

It is still early, but the first autonomy patterns are coming into focus. Adoption of Cursor Automations is growing quickly, with security review emerging as a strong automation use case.

Even more recently, SDK runs show early demand for turning Cursor’s agent infrastructure into a programmable platform customized to how each company builds software.

Methodology#

This report is based on aggregated Cursor product and engineering data, including agent usage, token consumption, accepted AI diffs, and merged PR activity.

Most time-series charts use trailing 7-day, 28-day, or 30-day averages to reduce short-term noise and make directional trends easier to see. Metrics are reported in aggregate and are intended to show broad patterns in how developers use AI to build software.

This report does not include data that users under Privacy Mode have chosen to opt-out from, including zero data retention with model providers.
